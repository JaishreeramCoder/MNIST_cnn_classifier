# Handwritten digit recognition using CNNs

In this repo, I have done Image Classification on the MNIST dataset using Pytorch. 
- Details about the neural network architecture and training weights can be obtained by uploading [model.onnx](https://github.com/JaishreeramCoder/MNIST_cnn_classifier/blob/temp/model-visualization/model.onnx) file in [Netron](https://netron.app/)
- The loss function used is cross-entropy, and the optimizer is the Adam optimizer. ReLU activation function was utilized between the layers, along with batch normalization.

During inference, the model achieved exceptional performance with the following metrics:
- Test Accuracy: 99.390%

- Precision: 99.410%

- Recall: 99.390%

- F1 Score: 99.399%
